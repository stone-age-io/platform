// Package metrics is the Prometheus exposition shared by the Control Plane and
// the edge agent.
//
// WHY PROMETHEUS AND NOT A JSON ENDPOINT. The point of a metrics endpoint is
// that something else already knows how to read it. A bespoke JSON shape needs
// a bespoke consumer, and this platform's users are integrators who already run
// Prometheus, Grafana Alloy, Telegraf or an uptime checker — all of which speak
// this format and none of which speak ours. The client library rather than a
// hand-written text encoder for the same reason the leaf config is validated by
// nats-server itself: there is no frontend test runner and no scrape test here,
// so a subtly malformed exposition (label escaping, `_total` conventions, NaN)
// would look fine and be wrong. It also costs no binary size — slackhq/nebula
// already links client_golang in.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No per-organization labels. The Control Plane
// can only count rows in its own database, so per-org series would be tenant
// names attached to inventory counts — customer-identifying, of no operational
// use, and a poor trade on an endpoint that defaults to open. The numbers that
// would justify a label (which site is offline, which bucket is stale) live
// inside an organization's NATS account, which this process has no credential
// for; leaf-sync exposes those from the edge, where they can actually be seen.
