// that restart containers. Running the checks inside the request would mean a
// NATS dial per probe (so a probe rate that scales with an unrelated setting),
// and — worse — a slow check would blow the prober's own timeout and be read as
// "unready", killing a container whose only problem is that the diagnostic was
// slow. Decoupling the two means the endpoint always answers instantly with a
// recent answer, and a check that hangs shows up as a stale report rather than
// as an outage.
//
// The staleness that buys is real and bounded: a report can be up to one
// interval old. Report.Checked carries the timestamp so a reader can see that
// for themselves rather than having to know the interval.
