// Package health is the readiness-check engine shared by the Control Plane
// (`stone-age serve`) and the edge agent (`leaf-sync run`).
//
// WHAT A READINESS CHECK IS FOR HERE. PocketBase already answers /api/health,
// and that answer is "the HTTP server is listening" — which is true of every
// interesting failure this platform has. A binary serving 200s while the NATS
// server does not trust its operator, or while `bootstrap` was run before
// `migrate up` and every tenancy flag silently went nowhere, is exactly the
// state an operator needs to be told about. So the checks here are deliberately
// about *the things that are silently wrong*, not about liveness.
//
// WHAT EACH PROCESS MAY CHECK. A check must be answerable first-hand by the
// process running it. The Control Plane holds the NATS operator and the $SYS
// account; it has no user credential in any organization's account, so it
// cannot read an org's KV — not `twin`, and not the `leaf_status` heartbeats
// leaf-sync writes. Those are visible to the console, because a browser
// connects with the logged-in user's own in-account credential, and to
// leaf-sync, because it runs inside the account. Do not "improve" a check here
// by giving the Control Plane a credential inside a tenant's account: that
// turns the platform from a credential issuer into a data-plane participant in
// every tenant's bus, which is the one boundary the whole NATS design is built
// around.

//     human should still fix it (at-rest encryption off, no browser-facing
//     WebSocket URL). Failing on these would refuse to serve stock dev
//     deployments, which are legitimately in this state.
//   - Skipped is "this check does not apply here" — no embedded NATS server, no
//     hub domain configured. Reporting it as OK would claim a check ran when
//     nothing was examined.
